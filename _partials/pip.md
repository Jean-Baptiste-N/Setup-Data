## Python packages

Now that we have a pristine `lewagon` virtual environment, it's time to install some packages in it.

First, let's upgrade `pip`, the tool to install Python Packages from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org). In the latest Powershell window where the virtualenv `lewagon` is activated, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then let's install some packages for the first weeks of the program:

```bash
pip install pytest pylint ipdb pyyaml nbresult autopep8 flake8
```

Let's install packages useful for API & Scraping:

```bash
pip install requests bs4
```

Finally, more Data Science packages:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab nbconvert pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
```

That's it for today. During the bootcamp, we'll install more packages but we'll talk about that later.

If you want to check which packages (and which version of that package) you have installed, you can run:

```bash
pip freeze
```
